When collection is disabled, you can still allocate through MMTk. But MMTk will not trigger a GC even if the heap is full. In such a case, the allocation will exceed the MMTk’s heap size (the soft heap limit). However, there is no guarantee that the physical allocation will succeed, and if it succeeds, there is no guarantee that further allocation will keep succeeding. So if a VM disables collection, it needs to allocate with careful consideration to make sure that the physical memory allows the amount of allocation. We highly recommend not using this method.
