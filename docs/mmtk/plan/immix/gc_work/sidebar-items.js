We need to: 1. add a plan-specific method to create scan work packets, as most plans use `ScanObjects` while immix uses `ScanObjectsAndMarkLines`, 2. use `ImmixSpace.trace_object()` which has an overhead of checking which trace method to use (with ImmixProcessEdges, we can know which trace method to use by statically checking `TraceKind`)."]]});
